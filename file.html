Several possibilities:

1) Use rbind

Before loop:

d = NULL

And in the loop:

d = rbind(d, data.frame(x, y, z))


2) Build empty data frame of desired size beforehand and fill by row

E.g. for 10 rows:
d = data.frame( x=rep(0, 10), y=rep(0,10), z=rep(0,10))

And in the loop (index i):

d[i, ] = c(x, y, z)


3) Build vectors first, dataframe after the loop

x = NULL
y = NULL
z = NULL

in the loop:

x = append(x, runif(1))
...

After loop:

d = data.frame(x, y, z)

Solutions 1&3 are slower but you don't need to know the final number of
rows in advance. Solution 2 is cleaner, in my opinion, but requires that
you know the final size.

Of course, for the particular example calculation you don't need a loop
at all:

x = runif(100)
y = x+1
z = x+y
d = data.frame(x,y,z)
